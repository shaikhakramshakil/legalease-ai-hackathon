# Legalease AI ‚öñÔ∏è‚ú®

**Legalease AI** is a revolutionary mobile-first application designed to demystify complex legal documents for the average person. Leveraging a powerful suite of Google Cloud AI technologies, our app transforms dense legal jargon into simple, actionable insights, making law accessible to everyone.

This project was built as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for our hackathon submission.

## üöÄ The Problem

In India, millions of people sign contracts, leases, and agreements every day without fully understanding the terms. Legal documents are often filled with complex language, hidden clauses, and risks that can lead to significant financial or personal hardship. The high cost and inaccessibility of legal advice leave many vulnerable.

## üí° Our Solution

Legalease AI is your personal AI-powered legal assistant. By simply uploading a document, users can get an instant, easy-to-understand breakdown of its contents. Our app highlights key clauses, identifies potential risks, and even translates the summary into Hindi, empowering users to make informed decisions with confidence.

## ‚ú® Key Features

Our MVP showcases a rich set of features designed to provide immediate value to users:

-   **üìÑ Document Upload & OCR**: Users can upload legal documents in various formats (PDF, JPG, PNG). Our pipeline uses Google's Document AI to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR), accurately extracting text and preserving the original layout, even from scanned images.

-   **ü§ñ AI-Powered Summarization**: At its core, Legalease AI uses **Gemini Pro** to generate concise, plain-language summaries. It intelligently identifies and highlights the most critical clauses, such as:
    -   Payment Dates & Amounts
    -   Penalties & Late Fees
    -   Renewal & Termination Conditions
    -   Liabilities & Obligations

-   **üö® Intelligent Risk Highlighting**: The app doesn't just summarize; it analyzes. Using models trained on Indian contract law, it applies color-coded tags to clauses, flagging them as `high`, `medium`, or `low` risk. This gives users an instant visual cue about which parts of the document require the most attention.

-   **üåê Bilingual Output (English & Hindi)**: To bridge language barriers, users can switch between English and Hindi with a single click. The translated summaries are generated using Google's advanced translation models, ensuring accuracy and readability.

-   **üí¨ Interactive AI Assistant**: Users can "chat" with their document. Our integrated AI assistant, powered by Gemini, allows users to ask specific questions about the document (e.g., "What happens if I miss a payment?") and receive contextual answers based on the document's content.

-   **üîä Text-to-Speech (Read Aloud)**: For enhanced accessibility, users can have the plain-language summary read aloud to them in either English or Hindi, powered by Google's Text-to-Speech AI.

-   **üì± PWA & Offline-First**: Built as a Progressive Web App (PWA), Legalease AI provides a seamless, native-like experience on mobile devices. It offers offline access to previously analyzed summaries, ensuring users can review their documents anytime, anywhere.
